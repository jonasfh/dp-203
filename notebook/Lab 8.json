					"# Lab 8 - End-to-end security with Azure Synapse Analytics\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"In this lab, you will learn how to secure a Synapse Analytics workspace and its supporting infrastructure. You will observe the SQL Active Directory Admin, manage IP firewall rules, manage secrets with Azure Key Vault and access those secrets through a Key Vault linked service and pipeline activities. You will understand how to implement column-level security, row-level security, and dynamic data masking when using dedicated SQL pools.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"After completing this lab, you will be able to:\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"* Secure Azure Synapse Analytics supporting infrastructure\r\n",
					"* Secure the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and managed services\r\n",
					"* Secure Azure Synapse Analytics workspace data\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"This lab will guide you through several security-related steps that cover an end-to-end security story for Azure Synapse Analytics. Some key take-aways from this lab are:\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"1. Leverage Azure Key Vault to store sensitive connection information, such as access keys and passwords for linked services as well as in pipelines.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"2. Introspect the data that is contained within the SQL Pools in the context of potential sensitive/confidential data disclosure. Identify the columns representing sensitive data, then secure them by adding column-level security. Determine at the table level what data should be hidden from specific groups of users then define security predicates to apply row level security (filters) on the table. If desired, you also have the option of applying Dynamic Data Masking to mask sensitive data returned in queries on a column by column basis."

					"Azure Synapse Analytics (ASA) is a powerful solution that handles security for many of the resources that it creates and manages. In order to run ASA, however, some foundational security measures need to be put in place to ensure the infrastructure that it relies upon is secure. In this exercise, we will walk through securing the supporting infrastructure of ASA."
