					"# Lab 11 - Create a stream processing solution with Event Hubs and Azure Databricks\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"In this lab, you will learn how to ingest and process streaming data at scale with Event Hubs and Spark Structured Streaming in Azure Databricks. You will learn the key features and uses of Structured Streaming. You will implement sliding windows to aggregate over chunks of data and apply watermarking to remove stale data. Finally, you will connect to Event Hubs to read and write streams.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"After completing this lab, you will be able to:\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"- Know the key features and uses of Structured Streaming\r\n",
					"- Stream data from a file and write it out to a distributed file system\r\n",
					"- Use sliding windows to aggregate over chunks of data rather than all data\r\n",
					"- Apply watermarking to remove stale data\r\n",
					"- Connect to Event Hubs read and write streams\r\n",

					"## Concepts\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"Apache Spark Structured Streaming is a fast, scalable, and fault-tolerant stream processing API. You can use it to perform analytics on your streaming data in near real time.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"With Structured Streaming, you can use SQL queries to process streaming data in the same way that you would process static data. The API continuously increments and updates the final data.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"### Event Hubs and Spark Structured Streaming\r\n",
					"Azure Event Hubs is a scalable real-time data ingestion service that processes millions of data in a matter of seconds. It can receive large amounts of data from multiple sources and stream the prepared data to Azure Data Lake or Azure Blob storage.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"Azure Event Hubs can be integrated with Spark Structured Streaming to perform processing of messages in near real time. You can query and analyze the processed data as it comes by using a Structured Streaming query and Spark SQL.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"### Streaming concepts\r\n",
					"Stream processing is where you continuously incorporate new data into Data Lake storage and compute results. The streaming data comes in faster than it can be consumed when using traditional batch-related processing techniques. A stream of data is treated as a table to which data is continuously appended. Examples of such data include bank card transactions, Internet of Things (IoT) device data, and video game play events.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"A streaming system consists of:\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"Input sources such as Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, IoT Hub, files on a distributed system, or TCP-IP sockets\r\n",
					"Stream processing using Structured Streaming, forEach sinks, memory sinks, etc.\r\n",
